        "Ever since I saw pictures of the Northern Lights on the internet, I've really wanted to see them in real life. I often watch videos and look at photos of them on Instagram. Wow! Every time, I feel so surprised and happy.",
        "The colours are amazing, and the way the lights move and dance in the night sky looks like magic. It's so beautiful. I told myself that one day, I will travel and see these lights with my own eyes.",
        "In 2022, I made a plan to go see the lights. I was so excited! But then, my trip had to be stopped. This was because of the war between Russia and Ukraine. I felt very, very sad when I couldn't go.",
        "But I didn't give up on my dream! I just waited. I kept hoping for a good time to try again. And finally, it happened! This year, in February 2025, I was able to go. My dream came true!"

        "My big trip started on February 6th. The first city I visited was Moscow. I stayed in Moscow for two days before I went north to a place called Murmansk.",
        "Moscow is a very beautiful city, and it's really big! There are many famous things to see there. I went to Red Square, which is a very famous big square. I saw the colourful church called St. Basil’s Cathedral – it looks amazing in photos, and it's amazing in real life too! I also took a walk near the Moscow River.",
        "It was nice to see Moscow, but really, I was thinking about just one thing all the time – seeing the Northern Lights! I couldn't wait to get to Murmansk."

        "You might ask, what are these Northern Lights? Some people call them Aurora Borealis. They happen when tiny bits fly from the sun and hit the air high up around the Earth. When these tiny sun-bits touch the gases in the air (like oxygen and nitrogen), they make beautiful lights shine in the sky.",
        "Most often, the colour you see is green. But sometimes, you can also see blue, red, or purple lights! The best places to see them are in countries close to the North Pole, like Norway, Canada, Iceland, and Russia."
