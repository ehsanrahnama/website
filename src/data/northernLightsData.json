        "Ever since I saw pictures of the Northern Lights on the internet, I've really wanted to see them in real life. I often watch videos and look at photos of them on Instagram. Wow! Every time, I feel so surprised and happy.",
        "The colours are amazing, and the way the lights move and dance in the night sky looks like magic. It's so beautiful. I told myself that one day, I will travel and see these lights with my own eyes.",
        "In 2022, I made a plan to go see the lights. I was so excited! But then, my trip had to be stopped. This was because of the war between Russia and Ukraine. I felt very, very sad when I couldn't go.",
        "But I didn't give up on my dream! I just waited. I kept hoping for a good time to try again. And finally, it happened! This year, in February 2025, I was able to go. My dream came true!"

        "My big trip started on February 6th. The first city I visited was Moscow. I stayed in Moscow for two days before I went north to a place called Murmansk.",
        "Moscow is a very beautiful city, and it's really big! There are many famous things to see there. I went to Red Square, which is a very famous big square. I saw the colourful church called St. Basil’s Cathedral – it looks amazing in photos, and it's amazing in real life too! I also took a walk near the Moscow River.",
        "It was nice to see Moscow, but really, I was thinking about just one thing all the time – seeing the Northern Lights! I couldn't wait to get to Murmansk."

        "You might ask, what are these Northern Lights? Some people call them Aurora Borealis. They happen when tiny bits fly from the sun and hit the air high up around the Earth. When these tiny sun-bits touch the gases in the air (like oxygen and nitrogen), they make beautiful lights shine in the sky.",
        "Most often, the colour you see is green. But sometimes, you can also see blue, red, or purple lights! The best places to see them are in countries close to the North Pole, like Norway, Canada, Iceland, and Russia."

        "After staying two days in Moscow, I took a plane to Murmansk. This city is way, way up north in Russia, very near the Arctic Circle. When I got there, it was very cold! But I didn't really feel the cold because I was just so excited to maybe see the lights."

        "I stayed in Murmansk for four days, really hoping I would see the Northern Lights. On the first night, I went out with a group of other people who also wanted to see them. We went to a dark place and waited, looking up at the sky.",
        "We waited for quite a long time. Then, suddenly, we saw a light green colour appear! At first, it was quite faint and small. But then it grew bigger and much brighter! The people with me started cheering and clapping. It was amazing! The lights moved slowly, like waves dancing in the sky. It was so beautiful. I couldn't take my eyes off them. I forgot about the cold and everything else. It was one of the best moments of my whole life."

        "The next night, I went on another tour with a guide called Alex. We drove out of the city for about 90 minutes (an hour and a half). We went somewhere with no street lights, so it was very dark. It felt even colder this night!",
        "But then, the lights came back! And when they did, I forgot all about being cold. This time, the colours were even stronger and brighter. I saw bright green, some blue, and even a little purple light dancing above us. We took many photos, but photos just can't show how truly beautiful it is. You have to see it with your own eyes to really understand."

        "Seeing the Northern Lights was my dream, and it came true! But now, guess what? I want to see them again! I'd love to go to other countries like Norway or Canada to see how they look there.",
        "So, if you also dream of seeing the Northern Lights, please don't give up hope. Maybe it will take time, like it did for me. But one day, you might see them too. And when you do, you will understand why everyone says it's like magic. For me, seeing them once is not enough. I know I will try to find these amazing lights again someday!"
