    bio: "Hi, I’m Ehsan Rahnama. I’ve been passionate about mathematics and physics ever since I was a kid. I chose to study mechanical engineering at university, but during my master’s degree, I realized what I really loved was artificial intelligence. I put my heart into my AI courses, earned an A in my final exam, and started learning even more on my own — teaching myself how to code AI algorithms in MATLAB.",

    bio: "After university, I decided to dive deeper into machine learning. I picked up Python by myself and kept studying until, after just six months, I earned a trial position at a computer vision company. I worked hard, quickly proved myself, and was promoted to a full-time role. Since 2020, I have been working on real-world problems: training models to detect objects through industrial surveillance cameras, converting models across different ML frameworks, and deploying them to embedded systems.",

    bio: "My journey in AI has been all about self-study, persistence, and passion. Mathematics has always been at the heart of how I think about AI, and physics continues to shape the way I understand the world. Even though I started out in a different field, my hard work and curiosity helped me find my true path.",
