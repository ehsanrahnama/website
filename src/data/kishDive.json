          "Once upon a time, after many months of staying at home and working remotely, I decided to take a break. The government announced that everything would reopen for a short time, and people could travel inside the country. I planned a trip to Kish Island, which is in the south of Iran, in the Persian Gulf. I bought a ticket for a tour and felt very excited to finally travel again.",
          "But one week before my trip, the government changed the rules. They said that all recreational sites and shopping centers would close again because of health reasons. Only hotels would stay open. I wanted to cancel my trip, but the travel agent told me they could not give my money back. They said I could either go or stay at home.",
          "I was not very happy, but I decided to go anyway. When we arrived in Kish, the weather was very hot and humid because it was August, the middle of summer. We tried to enjoy our time. We walked along the beach and rented e-bikes to ride around the island. It was nice, but for me, it was not exciting enough. I wanted something more thrilling.",
          "Then, I found a professional diving instructor. He offered me a private diving session. I said yes immediately. We planned to meet early in the morning.",
          "At 6 a.m., we went to the sea. I wore my diving suit and equipment and followed the instructor underwater. It was my first time diving deep into the sea, and it was an amazing experience. I saw many colorful fish swimming around me and some small sea creatures on the rocks. I felt like I was inside a different world.",
          "The dive lasted about 30 minutes, but it felt like only a few minutes because I enjoyed it so much. When I came back up, the sun was rising, and the view of the horizon was very beautiful. It was one of those moments I will never forget.",
          "Even though my trip did not go exactly as I planned, I made great memories. This dive was the best part of my trip. It reminded me that sometimes, unexpected adventures are the most special ones."
