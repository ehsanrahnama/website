    bio: "After university, I studied machine learning and started coding in Python. Within six months, I landed a trial position at a computer vision company, where I quickly proved my abilities and was promoted. In my four years at the company, I faced many challenges, including training models to detect objects with surveillance cameras in industrial conditions, converting models into different ML frameworks, and deploying models to embedded systems. In the last two years, I focused on finding conceptual scene changes in industrial environments to detect untidiness, and I published two articles on my work in arXiv.",
